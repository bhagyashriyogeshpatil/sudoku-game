# Sudoku Game
This is a simple Sudoku game implemented in Python. It allows users to play Sudoku interactively by entering their guesses for empty cells. The game also provides a solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
